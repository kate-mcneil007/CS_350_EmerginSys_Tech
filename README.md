1.	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project I worked on was creating a basic thermostat. Using a sensor I was able to create code which read the temperature of a room and display it. Along with reading the temperature the thermostat also included functionality to increase and decrease the temperature. The current temperature of the room was displayed along with the set point. If the setpoint was higher than the current temperature of the room then the heat would turn on. This was imitated through turning on an LED and displaying the heat as “1” meaning on. When the setpoint was lower than the temperature then the heat would turn off. The LED would be shut off and heat would be changed to a “0”. 

2.	What did you do particularly well?
I feel I did a good job of creating code which was able to change states based on input from its surroundings and users. I was able to successfully create a program which allowed users to manually change the temperature. It also displayed the current temperature based on readings from its sensor. 

3.	Where could you improve?
I feel I would like to keep practicing task schedulers as this was my first time working with one. I believe through experience I will become more proficient in making them. 

4.	What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I have learned about Code Composer studio through this course. It was also my first time working with C, a code which I feel all developers should be familiar with. It also gave me a lot of experience working with state machines and task schedulers. 

5.	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
I believe my knowledge on C will be particularly transferable as it is a code many other languages are built upon. By having a fundamental understanding of C one can also have a better understanding of the code they are building. The code is a lot more manual than other languages such as Python, however, I think this improves one’s coding skills. 

6.	How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The code has different functions which it calls upon. This makes it easy for one to add, edit, or delete functionality. By doing this the code can be easily adapted. It also helps maintain it as if anything needs to be changed or updated they simply need to go to the function that needs work and make changes there. This also makes the code readable as it is organized into different parts.
